<p>Following on the heels of the <a href="http://geonode.org/2011/05/roadmapping-summit/">Roadmapping Summit</a>, the Project Steering Committee has now approved a community patch review policy, with criteria for valid reviews.  If you are participating in GeoNode development, please look these over:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/wiki/Patch-Review-Process">Patch Review Process</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/wiki/Review-criteria">Patch Review Criteria</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Our hope is that making these policies explicit will ease community participation and ensure good code quality and test coverage. We welcome discussion and proposed changes to these policies, especially as they are tested by the community.</p>
