<p>A live demo of the latest stable build is available at demo.geonode.org. Anyone may sign up for a user account, upload and style data, create and share maps, and change permissions.  Since it is a demo site, we don’t make any guarantee that your data and maps will always be there.  But it should hopefully allow you to easily preview the capabilities of GeoNode.</p>
