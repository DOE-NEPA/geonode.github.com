<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>We are aware that there are many people out there who are interested in following GeoNode progress but do not want to be part of a high-traffic <a href="http://librelist.com/browser/geonode/">Users list</a> or highly-technical<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/opengeo.org/group/geonode-dev/topics"> Developers list</a>.</p>

<p>To serve these people better, we have created an <a href="http://groups.google.com/a/opengeo.org/group/geonode-announcements">Announcement list</a>.  It will be broadcast only (no discussion) of announcements pertaining to recent developments, PSC news, and project milestones.  We expect a maximum of one email per week. If you are interested, just <a href="http://groups.google.com/a/opengeo.org/group/geonode-announcements">subscribe</a>.</p>

<p>Announcements will be cross-posted to the users list, so anyone subscribed to that need not join.</p>

<p>Thanks for your interest!</p>
