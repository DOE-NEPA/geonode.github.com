<p>
GeoNode is a platform for the management and publication of geospatial data.  It brings together mature and stable open-source software projects under a consistent and easy-to-use interface allowing users, with little training, to quickly and easily share data and create interactive maps.
</p>
<p>
GeoNode's data management tools allow for integrated creation of data, metadata, and map visualizations. Each dataset in the system can be shared publicly or restricted to allow access to only specific users. Social features like user profiles and commenting and rating systems allow for the development of communities around each platform to facilitate the use, management, and quality control of the data the GeoNode instance contains.
</p>
<p>
GeoNode provides a cost-effective and scalable tool for developing information management systems. Itâ€™s also designed to be a flexible platform that software developers can extend or modify to meet particular needs. The Risk in a Box suite of tools, for example, is currently being developed in Indonesia, Mozambique, and the Caribbean to help countries assess their vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change.
